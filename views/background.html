        How readings are derived
      </h3>
      <p>
        
      
When consulting the I Ching, one begins with sources of entropy… traditionally either bundles of yarrow-stalks or tossed coins. From these, an algorithm is followed to arrive at a “reading”, which is then open to contemplation and interpretation. In the most popular form of the practice, this reading amounts to 6 bits of information, traditionally rendered as “hexagram” of six open/yin or closed/yang lines, e.g.:
䷺
      </p>
      <p>
      There is also the notion of extra energy or state in this system… less frequently, any line can be “moving” or unstable, in transition from open to closed, or vice versa. In this way, any reading has varying degrees of transition of instability, for example in this reading, we see that the two center lines are moving from yin to yang:
䷺ → ䷫
      </p><p> 

In addition to being a rich, multi-dimensional divination system worthy of more study, this is also an impressive amount of entropy for an algorithm that’s nearly 2.5 million . There are many spaces here for something… nature? Randomness? Some collective consciousness? To assert itself over the human world of ordered, stable binaries. 
         
      Notes: 
      <ul>
        <li>The move from divination from stalks to coins changes the likely reading outcomes.</li>
        <li>Universe impacts reading -> reading adjusts to describe universe</li>
      </ul>

        In refining on the binary system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz</a> was directly inspired by the I-Ching, titling his paper ""
        Explanation of the binary arithmetic, which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its usefulness, and on the light it throws on the ancient Chinese figures of Fu Xi".

        <ul>
          <li>Computer code is intended to be able to fully encode reality - any idea, image, business - described in 1s and 0s.
          </li>
          <li>I-Ching encodes reality with all returning to binary Ying and Yang, light dark. </li>
          <li>How is the universe built from simple building blocks? Is digital reality more or less real than the divined reality of I-Ching?</li>

  <h3>
    password generation</h3>
     <p>
      To this end, we propose a strong password generator rooted in the I Ching tradition. In this way, we can harness one particularly important modern need for entropy, namely cybersecurity, as an invitation to bring meditation on the underlying nature of reality into the quotidian and often frustrating world of password prompts and reset emails. 
</p><p>One goal would be to harness the original, often forgotten original yarrow-stick algorithm for consulting the Oracle, which contains more entropy than the coin-tossing method, and make this complex analog algorithm more accessible. Watching the algorithm work becomes a moment for connection with the 3000 years of commentary and exploration of the I Ching system, the passage of time, and the nature of randomness / randomness of nature. The output of this algorithm would be a detailed, nuanced I Ching reading which can offer both insight into the questions one is currently facing in their lives, as well as a strong, memorable password. To this end, we hope to use the binary nature of the I Ching to offer a variety of “down-conversions” of your hexagram to password strings compatible with a variety of “strong password” requirements held by different services. These could be either strictly numeric (casting from 6-bit numbers to 16-bit or 64-bit) or relying on strings pulled from interpretive texts to find more memorably passwords. For example:
</p><p>Original Hexagram Reading: ䷤ → ䷦ 
      </p><p>
Hexagram 37 is named 家人 (jiā rén), "Dwelling People". Other variations include "the family (the clan)" and "family members”
</p><p>
This is changing into:

Hexagram 39 is named 蹇 (jiǎn), "Limping". Other variations include "obstruction" and "afoot".
